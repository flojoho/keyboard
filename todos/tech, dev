TODOS

refactoring: put everything sound related in its own 'audio context' class/IIFE

tech: better solution for obligatory user input problem
bug: volume slider should be correctly set from the start



tech: clean up key event listeners

tech: modularize localStorage
  opt: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  opt: just load/save an entire object?
  opt: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

tech: maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code
