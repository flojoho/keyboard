INBOX

also show description/explanation (readme) in app? (ua tastenzuweisungen)

reset statistics (or at least the ones that don't make sense anymore)

tech: should i use a framework? (zb react, pro/con)

tech: extract localStorage (load/save) logic into own module?

tech: move oscillator logic to own module?













TODOS

midi support

tech: better solution for obligatory user input problem
bug: volume slider should be correctly set from the start

bug: remove clicking sound

track volume setting together with selected sound

also track transpose setting and noteNumbers (localStorage.statistics)
  increment count with every note played

add quarterstep transpose feature / intonation slider (for offtune recordings)



tech: clean up key event listeners

upper and lower limit for transpose feature

tech: modularize localStorage
  opt: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  opt: just load/save an entire object?
  opt: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

tech: maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code



recording functionality
  later also several track + overlaying them

include a link to a youtube video explaining the synthesizer or at least the github link
show youtube video of me playing a song (readme + index.html)

feature for saving synth settings

recording feature
