easier way to transpose? (zb press key to set as 440Hz)

add drum sounds?

add (optional) reverb with settings?

save and load separate offset values for right hand layout and left hand layout?











TODO / PRIO

create multitouch buttons layout for mobile devices (later add pitch slide feature)
  req: dec: how many buttons per row? how many rows?
  add buttons for semitone transposition
make it functional on mobile devices

make the notes fade in and out more softly (basic fixed ADSR)

add plus and minus buttons to the volume slider?
  on either side of the slider vs on one side right next to each other

bug: make the volume slider already show the correct volume when entering the page, not only after pressing the first key



what data do i want to track and what do i want to do with it?
  save timbre setting in localStorage?
what should the data structure look like? (also the data tracking api/interface)

save and load chosen keyboard layout

more sounds? build my own synthesizer?

make decay adjustable? (also gets saved in localstorage (also tracked?))
interactive visual ADSR envelope?
