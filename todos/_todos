easier way to transpose? (zb press key to set as 440Hz)

add drum sounds?

save and load separate offset values for right hand layout and left hand layout?

add quarterstep transpose feature / intonation slider (for offtune recordings)

also show description/explanation (readme) in app? (ua tastenzuweisungen)

bug: remove clicking sound

track volume setting together with selected sound

also track transpose setting and noteNumbers (localStorage.statistics)
  increment count with every note played

display tracked numbers somewhere?

upper and lower limit for transpose feature?

recording functionality
  later also several track + overlaying them

include a link to a youtube video explaining the synthesizer or at least the github link
show youtube video of me playing a song (readme + index.html)

feature for saving synth settings












TODO / PRIO

create multitouch buttons layout for mobile devices (later add pitch slide feature)
  dec: how many buttons per row? how many rows?
  how to fill the screen with note buttons? (also root note should be in the center)
  r: multitouch
make it functional on mobile devices

dec: use react?
  if yes:
    r: port javascript project to react
    r: deploy react project to github pages
  con:
    no react router support
    deploying to github pages more complicated

tech: separate UI from sound synthesis

add buttons for semitone transposition

midi support
  how can i connect my tablet to a midi output device?

tech: put everything sound related in its own 'audio context' class/IIFE

tech: better solution for obligatory user input problem
bug: volume slider should be correctly set from the start

tech: clean up key event listeners

tech: extract localStorage (load/save) logic into own module?
tech: modularize localStorage
  opt: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  opt: just load/save an entire object?
  opt: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

tech: maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code

make the notes fade in and out more softly (basic fixed ADSR)

add plus and minus buttons to the volume slider?
  on either side of the slider vs on one side right next to each other

bug: make the volume slider already show the correct volume when entering the page, not only after pressing the first key



full screen support?

tech: reset statistics (or at least the ones that don't make sense anymore)

tech: should i use a framework? (zb react, pro/con)

tech: move oscillator logic to own module?

what data do i want to track and what do i want to do with it?
  save timbre setting in localStorage?
what should the data structure look like? (also the data tracking api/interface)

save and load chosen keyboard layout

more sounds? build my own synthesizer?

make decay adjustable? (also gets saved in localstorage (also tracked?))
interactive visual ADSR envelope?
