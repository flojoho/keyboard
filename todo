INBOX

also show description/explanation (readme) in app? (ua tastenzuweisungen)

add my new left hand key layout (to be able to easily use arrow keys with my right hand)
  also add select for different keyboard layouts?
    if yes: specify the data abstraction for different key layouts

reset statistics (or at least the ones that don't make sense anymore)











RESEARCH

Web Audio API

web audio api garbage collection

web midi api










CONCEPT / DECISIONS

create multitouch buttons layout for mobile devices (later add pitch slide feature)

what data do i want to track and what do i want to do with it?
  save timbre setting in localStorage?

tech: extract localStorage (load/save) logic into own module?

tech: move oscillator logic to own module?

easier way to transpose? (zb press key to set as 440Hz)

add drum sounds?

tech: should i use a framework? (zb react, pro/con)

make decay adjustable? (also gets saved in localstorage (also tracked?))
interactive visual ADSR envelope?

add (optional) reverb with settings?









TODOS

midi support

tech: better solution for obligatory user input problem
bug: volume slider should be correctly set from the start

bug: remove clicking sound

track volume setting together with selected sound

also track transpose setting and noteNumbers (localStorage.statistics)
  increment count with every note played

add quarterstep transpose feature / intonation slider (for offtune recordings)



tech: clean up key event listeners

upper and lower limit for transpose feature

tech: modularize localStorage
  opt: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  opt: just load/save an entire object?
  opt: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

tech: maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code



recording functionality
  later also several track + overlaying them

include a link to a youtube video explaining the synthesizer or at least the github link
show youtube video of me playing a song (readme + index.html)

feature for saving synth settings
