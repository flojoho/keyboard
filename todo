INBOX
feature for saving synth settings
midi support
recording feature
should i use a framework? (zb react, pro/con)
add quarterstep transpose feature / intonation slider (for offtune recordings)
show youtube video of me playing a song (readme + index.html)
beschreibung/erklÃ¤rung adden (ua tastenzuweisungen)
readme verbessern






CONCEPT / DECISIONS

easier way to transpose? (zb press key to set as 440Hz)

save timbre setting in localStorage?

make decay adjustable? (also gets saved in localstorage (also tracked?))

tech: extract localStorage (load/save) logic into own module?

tech: move oscillator logic to own module?

add (optional) reverb with settings?

interactive visual ADSR envelope







TODOS

remove clicking sound

track volume setting together with selected sound

also track transpose setting and noteNumbers (localStorage.statistics)
  increment count with every note played

create multitouch buttons layout for mobile devices (later add pitch slide feature)

readme:
  what is it
  you can also set the volume by using the Ctrl/Alt keys and change the sound easily with the space bar

maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code

clean up key event listeners

upper and lower limit for transpose feature

modularize localStorage
  pos: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  pos: just load/save an entire object?
  pos: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

modularize keycode to noteNumber mapping data structure
  volume slider should be correctly set from the start

better solution for obligatory user input problem

add drum sounds?

recording functionality
  later also several track + overlaying them


committing this todo file vs keeping it in gitignore
  pro/con
splitting if up into multiple files?
  and put them into own folder? (and gitignore the entire folder)




later: include a link to a youtube video explaining the synthesizer or at least the github link
