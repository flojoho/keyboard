INBOX








CONCEPT / DECISIONS

easier way to transpose? (zb press key to set as 440Hz)

save timbre setting in localStorage?

make decay adjustable? (also gets saved in localstorage (also tracked?))

tech: extract localStorage (load/save) logic into own module?

tech: move oscillator logic to own module?

add (optional) reverb with settings?

interactive visual ADSR envelope

add drum sounds?

tech: should i use a framework? (zb react, pro/con)







TODOS

tech: better solution for obligatory user input problem
bug: volume slider should be correctly set from the start

bug: remove clicking sound

track volume setting together with selected sound

also track transpose setting and noteNumbers (localStorage.statistics)
  increment count with every note played

create multitouch buttons layout for mobile devices (later add pitch slide feature)

readme:
  what is it
  you can also set the volume by using the Ctrl/Alt keys and change the sound easily with the space bar

add quarterstep transpose feature / intonation slider (for offtune recordings)





tech: clean up key event listeners

upper and lower limit for transpose feature

tech: modularize localStorage
  opt: just use regular localStorageAPI for now and modularize later?
  opt: just load/save an entire object?
  opt: api:
    loadVolume()
    saveVolume()
    loadTranspose()
    saveTranspose()

tech: maybe dont make noteNumberFromKey() return integers including 0 because it's falsy to the outside code





recording functionality
  later also several track + overlaying them

include a link to a youtube video explaining the synthesizer or at least the github link
show youtube video of me playing a song (readme + index.html)

feature for saving synth settings

midi support
